abstract = {The future of supercomputing lies in massively parallel computers. The nodes of these machines will need a different kind of operating system than current computers have. Many researchers in the field believe that microkernels provide the kind of functionality and performance required. In this paper we discuss three popular microkernels, Amoeba, Mach, and Chorus, to show what they can do. They are compared and contrasted in the areas of process management, memory management, and communication.},
